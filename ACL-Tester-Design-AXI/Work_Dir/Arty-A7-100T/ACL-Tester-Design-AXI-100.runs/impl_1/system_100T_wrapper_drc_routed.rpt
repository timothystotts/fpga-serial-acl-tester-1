Related violations: <none>

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal system_100T_i/mig_7series_0/u_system_100T_mig_7series_0_1_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the system_100T_i/mig_7series_0/u_system_100T_mig_7series_0_1_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of system_100T_i/mig_7series_0/u_system_100T_mig_7series_0_1_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>
