2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer jb_pin10_iobuf/IBUF (in jb_pin10_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer jb_pin1_iobuf/IBUF (in jb_pin1_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#3 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer jb_pin4_iobuf/IBUF (in jb_pin4_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#4 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer jb_pin7_iobuf/IBUF (in jb_pin7_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#5 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer jb_pin8_iobuf/IBUF (in jb_pin8_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#6 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer jb_pin9_iobuf/IBUF (in jb_pin9_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#7 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer jc_pin4_iobuf/IBUF (in jc_pin4_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#8 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer qspi_flash_sck_iobuf/IBUF (in qspi_flash_sck_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#9 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer qspi_flash_ss_iobuf/IBUF (in qspi_flash_ss_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal system_100T_i/mig_7series_0/u_system_100T_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the system_100T_i/mig_7series_0/u_system_100T_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of system_100T_i/mig_7series_0/u_system_100T_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>
